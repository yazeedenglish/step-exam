        text: `(1) Fish are cold-blooded vertebrates that live in water. They differ greatly in size, shape, color and habits. Some fish may look like worms, while others may resemble rocks. All the colors of the rainbow can be found in fish. Some fish are very brightly colored while others can be very dull.

(2) Fish can live in almost any conditions of water. They can live in the freezing waters of Antarctica, hot jungle streams, lakes and fast flowing mountain rivers. Nearly all fish get their oxygen from water. Although we cannot see it, water does contain oxygen. To get this oxygen, the fish forces water through its gills. The gills absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide into the water which then passes out through the gills.

(3) Scientists have found over 21,000 different kinds of fish. They continue to find more species each year. Scientists who study fish are called ichthyologists. Fish are truly amazing animals to study and observe`,

        title: "Swiss Canal", // 4 Questions

        text: `(1) In 1859, thanks to the efforts of a French diplomat and politician, Ferdinand de
Lesseps, work started on the Suez Canal. Though he was not an engineer, he had
been haunted by the idea of the canal since his youth. De Lesseps spent a decade
supervising the massive operation that involved the excavation of about 97 million
cubic yards of earth.

(2) De Lesseps first established an artificial harbor at Port Said as a base and had a
canal dug from the Nile to the Suez to provide fresh-water for the 20.000 laborers.

(3) The official opening was on November 17, 1869. Representatives of almost every
European royal family attended the inauguration celebration. Ships from France,
Russia, Austria, Italy ,Britain, and the United States sailed through the canal and
de Lesseps’ dream was finally a reality. The total cost of the project was an
estimated $ 105 million, which at the time was a lot of money. This was more than
twice the original estimate, but it was a tiny sum compared with the value of the
canal to world trade.`,

        title: "World War II", // 5 Questions

        text: `(1) Modern wars bring death and destruction wherever they occur. Sophisticated weapons have been developed that can wipe out a whole city. The most destructive war in history is World War II, fought from 1939 to 1945. World War II involved gigantic struggles not only in Europe but in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific as well. More than 25 million military personnel and 30 million civilians were killed in the war. Its conduct strained the economic capabilities of the major nations and left many countries on the edge of collapse. World War II cost more than any three previous wars combined.

(2) Disasters continued even after the war ended. Damage to communication networks disrupted the transport of raw materials and finished products. The irregularity of supplies to industry and the destruction inflicted on the production apparatus resulted in a considerable number of temporary layoffs. Even in the victorious countries. food rationing continued well after the end of the war. Crime and law-breaking increased. The simultaneous reconstruction of accommodation, industry and the transport infrastructure stifled national economies. Under these conditions, people were first and foremost preoccupied with the restrictions affecting everyday life and often had difficulty in thinking about their long-term future. The shortage of coal in the very hard winter of 1946-1947 led to widespread strikes and mass demonstrations.`,

        title: "Device Driver", // 4 Questions

        text: `(1) A device driver is software that helps a peripheral device establish communication with a computer. This type of software is used by printers, monitors, graphics cards, sound cards, and modems. Once installed, a device driver usually runs in the background without opening a window on the screen. Suppose you connect a new printer to your computer. You might also have to install a printer driver or select a preinstalled driver. After the device driver is installed, it runs in the background to send data to the printer whenever you begin a print job.

(2) On a Mac, you can click the Apple icon, select About this Mac, and then select More Info to look at a list of devices connected to your computer. By selecting a device, you can view information about it, including the driver version number. It's always important to remain up- to-date, so check the manufacturer's website to make sure that your version is current. On a PC, if you need to update a device driver or change its settings. you can usually access the driver by using the Start menu's Control Panel option and opening the System icon. Then use the Device Manager option to view a list of your computer system hardware and corresponding device drivers.`,

    title: "Radio in Saudi Arabia", // 4 Questions

    text: `(1) The history of radio in Saudi Arabia goes back to 1949 when the airwaves were filled with the recitation of the Holy Qur'an that won the hearts of millions across the Kingdom. In the early decades, expensive, large wooden box radios were confined to the elite. Later, more advanced transistor radios reached the rest of the people. Today, in Saudi Arabia radio has been completely transformed by the various private players that have entered the sector since the government opened up licenses to them, creating more variety to add to the public stations. With the introduction of social media, many broadcasters thought that the time for radio was over. However the reality is quite different. Many listeners tune in to online radio stations nowadays, and a large number of listeners tune in while driving.

(2) Though there is a wide range of choice available to Arabic listeners, English listeners have little choice in the Kingdom. Only a few stations offer broadcast services in English such as Radio Riyadh. Meanwhile, Jeddah Radio's Urdu service broadcasts in the afternoon and has a large following. These programs are particularly popular during Hajj season, as they contain a variety of topics supported by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs.`,

    title: "GMO Bananas", // Questions 3

    text: `(1) Each year, thousands of children in East Africa go blind or die because they don't get enough vitamin A. Now, with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Ugandan, American and Australian researchers are trying to develop a potential fix: a genetically modified banana that packs a significantly larger vitamin A punch.

(2) The bananas have already been successfully tested on gerbils. Researchers created the new bananas by slightly tweaking its genome so that the fruit contains more alpha and beta caroteno-plantsynthesized substances that animals convert into vitamin A. The new bananas have a slight orange shade but taste the same as nongenetically modified bananas. Human trials just began in Iowa, and if they're successful, farmers in Uganda will be growing the GMO bananas by 2020. About 70 percent of people there rely on bananas as a major staple of their diets, so delivering the extra vitamin boost through the fruit should be an effective means of helping to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. If the GM banana scheme helps reduce death and blindness rates in Uganda, it could be transferred to other countries or applied to other fruits, like plantains.

(3) Bananas are not the only food whose yield or nutritional profile could be improved with genetic engineering. With climate change threatening to disrupt existing crops and growing global populations demanding more of those supplies, genetic engineering could be a solution for making the most of limited space and resources. Quite a number of foods that fit this profile have already been created including virus resistant squash, and disease-resistant potatoes.`,

    title: "The Spinal Cord", // Questions 4

    text: `(1) The spinal cord is an information highway connecting the nervous system to the brain. Ascending neural areas send up sensory information, and descending areas send back motorcontrol information. A look at the neural pathways that control our reflexes, our automatic responses to stimuli, shows the spinal cords work. A simple spinal-reflex path is composed of a single sensory neuron and a single motor neuron, which often communicate through an interneuron.

(2) One such path makes up the pain reflex. When your fingers touch a hot stove, neural activity excited by the heat travels via sensory neurons to interneurons in your spinal cord. These interneurons respond by activating motor neurons to the muscles in your arm, causing you to jerk your hand away.

(3) Because the simple pain-reflex pathway runs through the spinal cord and out, you jerk your hand from a candle's flame before your brain receives and responds to the information that causes you to feel pain. Information travels to and from the brain by way of the spinal cord. Were the top of your spinal cord severed, you would not feel such pain. Or pleasure. Your brain would literally be out of touch with your body. Thus, you would lose all sensation and voluntary movement in body regions whose sensory and motor neurons connect with the spinal cord below its point of injury.`,

    title: "Pioneers of Modern Medicine", // Questions 5

    text: `(1) Medieval physicians relied on the works of the ancient physician Galen. Galen, however, had made many errors, in part because he had limited knowledge of human anatomy. During the Renaissance, physicians made new efforts to study the human body. In 1543, Andreas Vesalius published "The Structure of the Human Body," the first accurate and detailed study of human anatomy. Vesalius used whatever means he could to increase his knowledge of anatomy. He used friendships with people of influence to get invitations to autopsies. He also autopsied bodies that he himself obtained - counting on friends in the local government to look the other way.

(2) In the early 1540s, French physician Ambroise Paré developed a new and more effective ointment for preventing infection. He also developed new surgical techniques, introduced the use of artificial limbs, and invented several scientific instruments. Then in the early 1600s, William Harvey, an English scholar, described the circulation of the blood for the first time. He showed how the heart serves as a pump to force blood through veins and arteries. Later in the century, the Dutch inventor Anton van Leeuwenhoek perfected the microscope and became the first human to see cells and microorganisms. These pioneering scientists opened the way for further discoveries.`,

    text: `(1) A chemical formula, in combination with the molar masses of its main elements, indicates the relative quantities of each element in a compound, which is extremely useful information. For example, about 30 years ago, scientists began to suspect that synthetic compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs) were destroying the ozone in Earth's upper atmosphere.

(2) Upper atmospheric ozone is important because it shields life on Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet light. CFCs are chemically inert compounds that were used primarily as refrigerants and industrial solvents. Over time, however, CFCs began to accumulate in the atmosphere. In the upper atmosphere, sunlight break bonds within CFCs, resulting in the release of chlorine atoms. The chlorine atoms then react with ozone, converting it into O2. Therefore, the harmful part of CFCs is the chlorine atoms that they carry.`,

    title: "Ancient Birds", // Questions 4

    text: `(1) Giant birds of the past have names that speak for themselves. The Elephant bird, a native of Madagascar and the largest known giant bird, stood at over nine feet tall and weighed in at 1,000 pounds or more, until it went extinct about 1,000 years ago. Australia's Mthirung, nicknamed "Thunderbird," which disappeared nearly 50,000 years ago, is thought to have been nearly seven feet tall and weighed between 500 and 1,000 pounds. But until now, no one had ever found evidence of these towering avians in Europe.

(2) Today, researchers describe the first fossil of a giant bird found in Crimea. Dated at around 1.8 million years old, the specimen makes experts question previous assumptions that giant birds were not part of the region's fauna during that period.

(3) A team of paleontologists dug up the fossil, an unusually large femur bone, in Taurida Cave, located on the Crimean Peninsula in the northern Black Sea. The cave was only discovered last June when the construction of a new highway revealed its entrance.

(4) Based on the femur's dimensions, the team calculated that the bird would have weighed around 992 pounds as much as an adult polar bear-making it the third largest bird ever recorded. Daniel Field, a scientist at the University of Cambridge, says, “It raises exciting questions about the factors that gave rise to these giant birds, and the factors that drove them to extinction."`,
